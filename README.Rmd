# mputr

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mputr is to make it easier to deal with multiple imputation.

It is an **experimental package** that may end up being worked back into `naniar`.

It's goals are to:

* Provide broom tidiers for multiple imputation objects (based on Andrew Heiss work: )
* Provide helpers for exploring multiple imputations
* Potentially provide an interface similar to `simputation`, but for multiple imputation.
