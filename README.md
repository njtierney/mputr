The goal of mputr is to make it easier to deal with multiple imputation.

It is an **experimental package** that may end up being worked back into
`naniar`.

It’s goals are to:

  - Provide broom tidiers for multiple imputation objects (based on
    Andrew Heiss work: )
  - Provide helpers for exploring multiple imputations
  - Potentially provide an interface similar to `simputation`, but for
    multiple imputation.
